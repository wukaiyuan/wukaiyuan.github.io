## Good ideas for A/B test experiments from the papers
* Combined experiments. Per-user with x% chance of seeing treatment
* Metrics definitions as discussed in the Microsoft paper
* Learning experiments where you intentionally degrade the experience to see how it affects the baseline
* Digging deeper into adoption and retention
* Surprising results should be replicated
* Risk of focusing on small changes is incrementalism. Should be tried to get some high ROI but also some big bets for audacious goals
* Changes rarely have a big impact to key metrics – corollary: only ~10% of experiments have any positive result
* Metrics improvements should be diluted to their segment size (mobile -> overall MW)
* Borderline significant results should be tentative and experiments rerun to verify
* If the result is so good (e.g. 8 sd from mean) then check again even if statistically significant
* Best to test yourself as many explanations for amazing A/B test results are wrong
* Can quantify latency’s effects by artificially slowing down a site
* Can we do a speed-up experiment by allowing response and delaying loading social column?
* Reducing abandonment is hard, shifting clicks is easy
* Delta method instead of bootstrap when data sizes are large (See Casella & Berger - Statistical Inference or Wasserman - All of Statistics)
* ANOVA as an alternative to t-tests when comparing the means of more than 2 samples
* Check experiment groups religiously for equal sizes and variances via A/A tests
* Check for browser-specific bugs
* Filter out users who didn’t even reach the page you have the treatment on for lower variance and better power (aka triggering)
* Check for server-related caching issues
